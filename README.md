This project will take an Iterable of Iterables and pretty print them.

List of things I gotta fix in order of descending importance:
  * [ ] make the code neater
  * [ ] figure out a way to update data and have table update as well
  * [ ] make some table types
  * [ ] implement ChainMap feature for cell/row/table level config
  * [ ] config file styles
  * [ ] maybe implement as a print statement instead of a container object
  * [X] get borders working
  * [X] mutable default value in TableFormat
  * [X] figure out how to format the dividers
  * [X] mutliline cells
