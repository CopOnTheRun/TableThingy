This project will take an Iterable of Iterables and pretty print them.

List of things I gotta fix:
* Future
  * implement ChainMap feature for cell/row/table level config
  * config file styles
  * make some table types
  * figure out a way to update data and have table update as well
  * maybe implement as a print statement instead of a container object
  * get borders working
* Finished
  * ~~mutable default value in TableFormat~~
  * ~~figure out how to format the dividers~~
  * ~~mutliline cells~~
